<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Nature may have a lot to do with our food choices and overall relationship with food. Just as you are born with a particular shape to your face, head, nose, and set of your eyes and eye color, you are destined to reach a certain height, and you are also born with an inherent neurotransmitter profil.</p>

<p>In 30 years of practice, I have met many different styles and choices of eating preferences in people. Some, have a deep relationship with their foods and some just do not care at all what they eat. This part of our personality will not change but can also be altered upon some determination.

  Most of what we are is established early, so much so that research states that in our early years we are operating on almost all determinations as a result of genetics. Later in life, by as early as age 7, we have already started to make alterations as a result of newly learned behaviors, as a result of our environment.</p>
